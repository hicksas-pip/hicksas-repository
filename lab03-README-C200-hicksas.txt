- I completed all of the parts of the lab tasks. I looked at canvas and experimented on my own based off of what 
was shown on canvas.
- How often do programmers use docstrings in their code?
- I stuck to the basics and didn't add any clever or special code.
- Having me make this readme file first was a little confusing and I only fully understood its purpose
when I reached the end of the assignment.
