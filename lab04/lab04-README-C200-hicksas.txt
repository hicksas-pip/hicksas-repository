1) I completed the first speedometer by calculating the speed of the animal and returning it. I completed the animal_average_speed by assigning each animal type to an animal and then using if, elif, and else statements to check if the animal_type was equal to any of the animals' average speeds'. I completed the animal_speed_compare by using the functions I previously made in order to calculate speed. Then using if, elif, and else statements I was able to check if animal1 was faster or slower than animal2.

2) I have no questions

3) I wouldn't call any of my code "clever"

4) This lab was very clear and easy to understand for me
