    Problem Description
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Different types of animals can run at different speeds.
    Using if statements, return the (average) speed of the animal
    based on the type that is given.

    Animal     |  Animal Type |  Average speed (mph)

    Problem Description
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Make sure to use the first two functions in this file to help you!
    Given the input data for the speed of some animal (animal1), and the type of a *different* animal (animal2),
    return a string based on whether the first animal's speed is greater than the average speed of the other animal.

        animal1_pos2 - the final position of the animal
